For the datacollection, there were 2 main parts:

the first one is collecting customers data. such as personal information,
payment card information, desired times for reservation.
this was done mainly through forms on the website that the user filled in.

Reservationsystem/app/views


2nd part , was to collect the realtime data from the sensor devices across
the internal system.
